Sample: CUDA Video Encode (C Library) API
Minimum spec: SM 1.0

This sample demonstrates how to effectively use the CUDA Video Encoder API encode H.264 video.  Video input in YUV formats are taken as input (either CPU system or GPU memory) and video output frames are encoded to an H.264 file

Key concepts:
