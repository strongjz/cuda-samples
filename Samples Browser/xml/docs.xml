We focus on the Bi-Conjugate Gradient Stabilized and Conjugate Gradient iterative methods, that can be used to solve large sparse nonsymmetric and symmetric positive defi- nite linear systems, respectively. Also, we comment on the parallel sparse triangular solve, which is an essential building block in these algorithms.]]></description>
