Sample: SLI D3D10 Texture
Minimum spec: SM 1.0

Simple program which demonstrates SLI with Direct3D10 Texture interoperability with CUDA.  The program creates a D3D10 Texture which is written to from a CUDA kernel. Direct3D then renders the results on the screen.  A Direct3D Capable device is required.
