Sample: Simple D3D11 Texture
Minimum spec: SM 1.0

Simple program which demonstrates Direct3D11 Texture interoperability with CUDA.  The program creates a number of D3D11 Textures (2D, 3D, and CubeMap) which are written to from CUDA kernels. Direct3D then renders the results on the screen.  A Direct3D Capable device is required.
